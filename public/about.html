<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 25-year-old technology enthusiast with a strong passion for
  solving problems and creating smart, automated solutions. I have hands-on experience with a variety of
  technologies, including SQL, SQL Server, JavaScript, Java, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Kotlin, and Python.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development (ADS) and working in a software house in the Support and
  Integration team. My role allows me to dive into real-world challenges where I can apply my skills to streamline
  processes and improve efficiency.</p>

<p>I love automation and have developed several impactful solutions at work â€” such as automated email notifications
  using Node.js, and database backup automation with Node.js and PowerShell, including secure FTP file transfers. No
  matter the challenge, I always find a way to deliver results.</p>
